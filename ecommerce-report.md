# Vulnerability Assessment Report: E-Commerce Company
This assessment was done as part of the courework for the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate.

### System Description
The server hardware consists of a powerful CPU processor and 128GB of memory. It runs on the latest version of Linux operating system and hosts a MySQL database management system. It is configured with a stable network connection using IPv4 addresses and interacts with other servers on the network. Security measures include SSL/TLS encrypted connections. The database itself has been open to the public for the last three years.

### Scope
The scope of this vulnerability assessment relates to the current access controls of the system. The assessment will cover a period of three months, from June 2023 to August 2023. NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 is used to guide the risk analysis of the information system.

### Purpose
The database server is a system that contains large amounts of (potential) customer information and data. The server’s main function is to store customer, campaign, and analytic data that can be utilized to track employee performance and craft more effective marketing efforts. The marketing team’s reliance on this server makes it critical for the company’s continued success.

### Risk Assessment

|Threat source |Threat event|Likelihood|Severity|Risk|
|-------------|------------|-----------|--------|----|
|Competitor|Obtain sensitive information via exfiltration, Perform reconnaissance and surveillance of organization|3|3|9|
|Employee| Alter/Delete critical information|2| 2| 4|
|Hacker|Preform reconnaissance and surveillance of organization, obtain sensitive data via exfiltration, Alter/Delete critical information|3| 3| 9|


### Approach
Risks considered the data storage and management methods of the business. The likelihood of a threat occurrence and the impact of these potential events were weighed against the risks (sensitive data exposure to competitors and malicious actors) to day-to-day operational needs (the continued accessibility of the database to employees).

### Remediation Strategy
Implementation of authentication, authorization, and auditing mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users access the database server. 

Specifically, this includes using strong passwords, role-based access controls, and multi-factor authentication to limit user privileges. Encryption of data in motion using TLS instead of SSL. IP allow-listing to corporate offices to prevent random users from the internet from connecting to the database.
